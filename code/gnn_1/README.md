## Training GNN1

### Training DiSCoMaT GNN1
```bash
for seed in 0 1 2; do
    bash run_discomat.sh $seed
done
```

### Training DiSCoMaT w/o features GNN1
```bash
for seed in 0 1 2; do
    bash run_discomat_wo_features.sh $seed
done
```

### Training DiSCoMaT w/o constraints GNN1
```bash
for seed in 0 1 2; do
    bash run_discomat_wo_constraints.sh $seed
done
```

### Training v-DiSCoMaT GNN1
```bash
for seed in 0 1 2; do
    bash run_vdiscomat.sh $seed
done
```

All the above experiments can be parallelized easily. Hyper-parameters can be modified from within .sh scripts.

### Generating results using different material ID thresholds
Once a model is trained, various result files using different MID thresholds can be generated by running the following script:
```
bash generate_res_files_for_all_alphas.sh
```
After generating the result files, refer to the evaluation folder to obtain compiled scores.
