## DiSCoMaT Evaluation

### Combined GNN1 and GNN2 results
```bash
bash compute_combined_results.sh
```

This prints the results for all 5 models: DiSCoMat, DiSCoMat w/o features, DiSCoMat w/o constraints, DiSCoMat w/o caption, and v-DiSCoMat. All five metrics (TT Acc., ID F1, TL F1, MatL F1, CV) are displayed.

### Combined Best GNN1 and GNN2 results by tuning MID threshold
```bash
bash find_best_alpha_results.sh
```
This also prints all metrics for all 5 models mentioned above. It assumes the presence of results files for all 5 models for both GNN 1 and GNN 2, which can be generated by generate_res_files_for_all_alphas.sh in gnn_1 and gnn_2 folders.

### Table Type results
```bash
bash compute_table_type_results.sh
```

This prints the results for all table types (SCC, MCC-CI, and MCC-PI) for all 5 models. All four metrics (ID F1, TL F1, MatL F1, CV) are displayed.
