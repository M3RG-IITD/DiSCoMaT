d(Si-O-Si),Peak at ~800,After immersion in SBF,After immersion in SBF,After immersion in SBF,After immersion in SBF,Formation of 3-D silica like structure.,[19]
v 2(CO3 2-),Sharp small peak at ~871,,,,,Characteristic band for CO3 2- in carbonated apatite.,[25]
SiONBO,Shoulder at ~930,Permanent,Permanent,Permanent,Permanent,Intensities of peaks are lower and shifted to higher frequency ~950 indicating presence of lower amount of non-bonding oxygen (NBO) or interaction with Na+. Intensities are decreased due to cation leaching in SBF.,[19]
v asym(Si-O-Si) (stretching),Intense broad peak at ~1020,As-prepared particles,As-prepared particles,As-prepared particles,As-prepared particles,The broad complex band at 900-1200 is difficult to analyze due to overlap of P-O and Si-O groups which absorb in this region. The broad peak shift to the higher wave number after immersion in SBF is likely a result of hydration.,[19]
